    <div class="content">
      <p>(bad english warning) you found my note! great, it was not that important and easy, but okay, as you wish dude, youre probably the one that was wandering around and then got interested what i have in my bio, or a friend, that cant let me just go.</p>
      <p>i dont wanna talk about anything, my suicidal thoughs are getting bigger and bigger, i want to die. i just slowly cut myself in silence, but this day makes me want to completely cut my throat.</p>

        <p>i dont want to speak out, im so desperate for attention, even for a second, but at same time, im scared of a lot of attention, i want so friends tslk with me everyday, but they wont and they will find it weird. all i do in my life is suffer and do nothing all day like a lazy shit. i never look what happens outside because of internet.</p>
        <p>i just look at all my photos and things i do and ask "why am i doing it?". friends in real life? all of them are shit, im never gonna tell my real feelings. my body looks worse, i hate myself.</p>

          <p>im know world would still spin if i die, news wont say anything, friends will forget me in a day. i believe if i die, everyone will finally be able to rest and dont share shit or take care about me.</p>
          <p>its probably all i want to say.</p>

          <p>i hope youll be okay! currently im alive, but planning to, and i think it will be just a random person.</p>
